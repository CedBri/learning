# **Logic Gates**
## What's a logic gate?
* Can be refered at as a "boolean function"
* Will return a single value back
* We can see `False` as the boolean value "0" and `True` as the boolean value
 "1"

## Why are logic gates important?
Usually used for "simple logic"\
Ex.: If something **True** then **...**

## AND, OR & NOT

### *AND gates*
| Input |   | Output |
|-------|---|--------|
| A     | B | Result |
| 0     | 0 | 0      |
| 0     | 1 | 0      |
| 1     | 0 | 0      |
| 1     | 1 | 1      |

### *OR gates*
| Input |   | Output |
|-------|---|--------|
| A     | B | Result |
| 0     | 0 | 0      |
| 0     | 1 | 1      |
| 1     | 0 | 1      |
| 1     | 1 | 1      |

### *NOT gates*
| Input | Output|
| ----- |  -----|
|   0   |   1   | 
|   1   |   0   |

## Priority in logic gates
1. Parentheses () are the highest proprity.
2. NOT operator
3. AND operator
4. OR operator

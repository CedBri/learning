# Repetition
## For loops
Example:
```python
    for i in range(100):
        print("hello")
```
We can also use `for` loops to iterate through lists
```python
    for i in my_array:
        print(i)
```

## While loops
While loops are usually used when the number of loops is not known. We usually use it with conditions instead of a range for example.
```python
    while int(input("Enter the number 10")) != 10:
        print("Dude, enter the number 10!")
```
